## Areas for Improvement

As part of the ongoing improvement of this project, here are some suggestions for future iterations:

- **Refactoring of the Add Form (`CardInfo.jsx`)**: The current form could benefit from refactoring to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Adding Animations**: Integrating animations could enhance the user experience.

- **Introducing a Dedicated Context**: Implementing a dedicated context would help separate the logic in `App.jsx`, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to manage.
